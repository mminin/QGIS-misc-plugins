# QGIS Miscellaneous plugins:

##SortLayers
Sorts Layers in QGIS Layers Panel 

To use:
copy directory "SortLayers" into your ".qgis2/python/plugins" directory;

switch to ".qgis2/python/plugins/SortLayers";

from linux terminal run "make clean; make".

(if you don't run make, it won't load into QGIS - this step is required)

Enable plugin in QGIS.

There are two buttons: one will sort layers alphabetically from A to Z.

Another will sort from Z to A.

This should work with QGIS 2.4 and up.
